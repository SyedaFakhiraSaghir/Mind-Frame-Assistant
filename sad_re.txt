It\'s so hard to forget pain, but it\'s even harder to remember sweetness.
We have no scar to show for happiness. We learn so little from peace.
You don’t walk this path alone.
If you want to be happy, do not dwell in the past, do not worry about the future, and focus on living fully in the present.
It\'s okay to not be okay.
I would advise you to call a friend.
It\'s okay to feel scared. We all do.
It\'s not silly to feel the way you do.
You\'re not alone.
Even though I don’t understand what you\'re going through, I\'m here for you if you need me.
I\'ll stay with you for as long as you need me to be.
