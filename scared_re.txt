Even though I don\'t understand what youâ€™re going through, I\'m here for you if you need me.
It\'s okay to feel this way.
It\'s okay to feel scared. We all do.
It\'s not silly to feel the way you do.
It\'s okay to not be okay.
You\'re allowed to feel anxious, even if you don\'t know the reason why.
Your fear is not silly.
I\'m always here if you need to talk.
I love you, no matter what.
I\'ll stay with you for as long as you need me to be.
