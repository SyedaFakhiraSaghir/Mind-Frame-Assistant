There is no path to happiness; happiness is the path.
Don\'t worry. Be happy:)
It is high time you tell yourself: I have chosen to be happy because it\'s good for my health.
Happiness is a journey, not a destination.
No medicine cures what happiness cannot.
They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: Someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for.
Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom.
Sanity and happiness are an impossible combination.
Happiness is a state of mind. It\'s just according to the way you look at things.
Stay happy!!! The best way to cheer yourself up is to try to cheer someone else up.
