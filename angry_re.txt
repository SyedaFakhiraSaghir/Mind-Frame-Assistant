The best fighter is never angry.
Anybody can become angry that is easy, but to be angry with the right person and to the right degree and at the right time and for the right purpose, and in the right way is not within everybody\'s power and is not easy.
If you spend your time hoping someone will suffer the consequences for what they did to your heart, then you\'re allowing them to hurt you a second time in your mind.
Letting go gives us freedom, and freedom is the only condition for happiness. If, in our heart, we still cling to anything - anger, anxiety, or possessions - we cannot be free.
Anger, resentment and jealousy doesn\'t change the heart of others-- it only changes yours.
Anger is an acid that can do more harm to the vessel in which it is stored than to anything on which it is poured.
In times of great stress or adversity, it\'s always best to keep busy, to plow your anger and your energy into something positive.
Learn this from me. Holding anger is a poison. It eats you from inside. We think that hating is a weapon that attacks the person who harmed us. But hatred is a curved blade. And the harm we do, we do to ourselves.― Mitch Albom
Let today be the day you stop being haunted by the ghost of yesterday. Holding a grudge & harboring anger/resentment is poison to the soul. Get even with people...but not those who have hurt us, forget them, instead get even with those who have helped us.― Steve Maraboli, Life, the Truth, and Being Free
Don’t waste your time in anger, regrets, worries, and grudges. Life is too short to be unhappy.― Roy T. Bennett
